      <h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Elon Reeve Musk (born June 28, 1971) is an international businessman and
        entrepreneur known for his leadership of Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and
        The Boring Company. Musk has been the wealthiest person in the world
        since 2021; as of May 2025, Forbes estimates his net worth to be over
        US$420 billion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Born in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk displayed a strong interest in
        computing and technology from an early age. He taught himself
        programming and sold his first video game at the age of 12. After
        attending Queen’s University in Canada, he transferred to the University
        of Pennsylvania, earning dual bachelor’s degrees in physics and
        economics. In 1995, Musk dropped out of a PhD program at Stanford to
        pursue business ventures, co-founding Zip2, an online city guide
        software company. He later co-founded X.com, which evolved into PayPal,
        revolutionizing online payments.
